how to make Red velvet cake step by step........


Step 1. First preheat your oven to 350 F (176 C) .Next let's make our cake  batter. Start by  creaming your butter and your white granulated or caster sugar together in a large bowl. Use the hand mixer or stand mixture to do this.

Step 2. Now we add in our eggs one at a time. So drop one egg in , mix, once that egg is completely incorporated do the other egg. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as well with a spatula.

Step 3. Now we add in our cocoa powder.It is a good idea to run it through some kind of a sifter. Cocoa power tends to get a bit lumpy. Then mix again and scrape the slides as need. Throughout this whole process we don't want to oveer mix, just untill things are incorporated.If we mix too much air into the batter which can cause air pockets in our cake.

Step 4. Now add in your vinalla extract to your buttermilk as well as your white vinegar. If you don't have buttermilk you can make same by taking just shy of one cup of regular milk and adding one tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar and then let it sit out for about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and vanilla extract until combined.

Step 5. Now we add in our oil to the buttermilk mixture. Next add in about 2 to 2 and 1/2 Tablespoons of red food coloring liquid.Then stir, until the mixture is a nice red color. Set that mixture aside for now.

Step 6. Next we will add our salt and baking soda to our flour. You can us e cake flour or all- pourpose flour. Cake floor tends to work a little bit better, but all-pourpose works great too. Use a whisk to combine those ingrediants.

Step 7. Next we will add in about half of our food coloring buttermilk mixture and about half of our flour mixture, then turn on the mixture and mix until just combined. Give the sides of the bowl a good scrape, then complete the process until all the ingredients have been mixed leaving you with a nice red velvet cake batter.

Step 8. Now we just fill up two 9 inch or 8 inch cake pan with equal ammounts of cake batter. Make sure to use shortening or kitchen spray on the pans and then dust them with cocoa powder or flour and I always add a little round cut out of parchment paper on the bottom too as an added precatution and my nonstick pans are great , but I like to over-do it. lol Also it is a good idea to lightly tap the pan with the batter in it, this will allow any cake bubbles to rise to the top, which helps to prevent air pocket , but sometimes it is unavoidable and you just get them, a combination of over mixing, etc. But it won't effect the taste of the cake at all! So don't worry about it. I never do. lol now bake those cakes for 23 to 30 minutes until when a toothpick comes out clean after poking it in the middle.

Step 9. Now after the cakes come out of the oven let's leave them alone and allow them to cool in their pan for about 10 minutes. After that we can remove them from their pans, remove the parchment paper and then let the cakes cool completly on the rack. Afterwards you can place in the fridge and let them chill, which helps the forsting or just go onto the frosting step now, it's totatly up to you!

Step 10. Well now it is time to make our foresting, we will be using just a few ingrediants, cream cheese, butter, vanilla extact and of course powdered sugar (confectioner's sugar).

Step 11. Now combine the cream cheese, butter and vinilla extract into a large bowl mix with hand mixture until nice and smooth usually takes a few minutes. Then slowly incorporate all of the powdered sugar.You may need more or less depending on the consistency that you want. Next just remove the beaters. Foresting is ready to go. At this point if the foresting is still too runny add more powerderd sugar or just chill it for about 30 minutes  before  foresting the cake.


Step 12. First we will trip the cake so it will be somewhat level. You can skip this step if you like. I just always use my bread knife to cut the top off of the bottom layer, if you want to use fondant I recommend cutting the top of the top layer off as well, the end product will look a bit better. Next add a bunchof foresting to the middle ,then layer the top layer of cake on. Then cover that whole cake with foresting. There are a variety of tools that you can use, I normaly use my cake spatula. Once done put the cake in the fridege for about 30 minutes. This is optional, but in like to do it, allows the foresting to set a bit.

Step 13. Now I want to make a heart shaped cake topper. To do that I take my heart cookie cutter and cut out a shape from the middle of that piece of cake that I have. Then just place it on top of your cake. Looks pretty neat right?

Step 14. Now take the rest of your leftover cake and crumble it up with your fingers. Then gently apply it to your cake sides or on top or skip this step. It is totally up to you how you decorate your cake. Use a piping bag and pipe foresting around the top of your heart if you like. You are done! Now place the cake in the fridge for about 2 hours before serving. Enjoy!!
